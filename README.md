# sam-wrapper example

This repository indicates an example of AWS SAM CLI wrapper which is called as `samw` in this repository.

Using `samw`, developers need not to install AWS SAM CLI on their PCs as long as you have docker installed.

See `Makefile` for details on how to run the `samw` command to invoke AWS Lambda functions locally and so on.
